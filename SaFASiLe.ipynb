    "\n",
    "SUMMARY:\n",
    "This program learns gestures from american sign language (ASL). The dataset comes from Kaggle. With this prgram you are\n",
    "able to train a neural network to identify hand gestures from ASL. Use it as a module your code or a standalone program.\n",
    "My goal was bulding a small and fast neural network. You are very welcome to rebuild it. See variables part to refine the\n",
    "code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program contains 3 big parts:\n",
    "    - neural network\n",
    "    - federated learning\n",
    "    - secure learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concepts meet with the requirements from SPAIC Keystone Challange: ND185, Lesson 9, Chapter 8\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "REQUIREMENTS:\n",
    "PySyft 0.1.16a1\n",
    "PyTorch 1.0.1\n",
    "TorchVision 0.2.2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "You have to save the trained model if you want to use it next time.\n",
    "For saving you have to use the 'torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH)' process.\n",
    "For loading you have to use the 'torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH)' process.\n",
    "PATH is the path of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "VARIABLES:\n",
    "***************\n",
    "batch size:    Batch size during training. It's better if the size is higher than the number of result categories.\n",
    "epochs:        Count of training epoch Higher numbers aren't always better since overfitting. Watch out, this model could be\n",
    "               overfitted over 35-45 epoch. If you want to prevent this, use higher dropout value, or make a bigger model. \n",
    "               Default value: 1\n",
    "learning_rate: Learning rate of optimizer. I use ADAM. Default value: 0.0001\n",
    "size:          One dimension from the size of input pictures (28x28). You have to change this if you use other source with\n",
    "               different sizes. Be careful, you have to transform your data before load it. Default value: 28\n",
    "num_workers:   Number of workres during training. Default value: 1\n",
    "***************\n",
    "hidden_1:      Number of hidden layers. Be careful, this model contains fully connected layers. Default value: 256\n",
    "hidden_2:      Number of hidden layers. Be careful, this model contains fully connected layers. Default value: 256\n",
    "output:        Number of result categories. If you want to predict more gestures, you have to change it a higher value.\n",
    "               Default value: 25\n",
    "dropout:       Value of dropout rate, where 0=0% (no dropout) and 1=100%. The value must be between 0 and 1. Higher value\n",
    "               means higher dropping to prevent overfitting. However higher value causes longen the training process.\n",
    "               Default value: 0.2\n",
